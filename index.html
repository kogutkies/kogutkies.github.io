    <h3>Hello! If you are seeing this you might have been one of my friends trying to re-visit the link, but 12/03/2024 on 10:47 I've decided that I should take the website down, due to maybe future problems with law. This website was an</h3><h2 id="red"> ip grabber</h2><h3> and I was curious how do I make it and how does it work. All the saved IP addresses were deleted on 10:50 12/03/2024 and are not shared with anyone else besides me also fun fact, this website was supposed to be a pedophile catcher, but it turned into a joke website instead.</h3><h3> That's all from me -- Kogutkies</h3>
